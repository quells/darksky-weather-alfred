Alfred Weather Powered by Dark Sky
==================================

# Archived 2024-01-01 in light of the Dark Sky API shutting down a while back.

A Python script to display the current weather conditions from the Dark Sky API in Alfred. You will need Alfred 3 and a free Dark Sky API key to use this.

# Installation

[Download](https://github.com/quells/darksky-weather-alfred2/blob/master/Weather.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

To install the Dark Sky Weather workflow, double click on ```Weather.alfredworkflow``` or drag the workflow to the workflow window in Alfred.

1. Use the [registration form](https://darksky.net/dev/register) to create a free Dark Sky developer account to get an API key.
2. [Find your latitude and longitude](http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php), but don’t use more than 4 decimal places.
3. Decide what units you would like to use for temperature. Options include Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

Next, edit the first script filter by double clicking on it. Edit the line ```print darksky(“APIKEY”, “LAT”, “LONG”, “TEMP_UNITS”)``` to fill in your Dark Sky API key, location, and unit preference. Be sure to keep these in quotes.

Example: ```print darksky(“abc123”, “52.2053”, “0.1218”, “C”)```

# How to use

Simply type ```weather``` (or whatever you configure) into Alfred. If your API access is successful, the current temperature and weather condition should appear followed by a summary of weather in the near future.

If you want more information, hit ```enter``` once the current weather has been displayed. This will open [Dark Sky](http://darksky.net) in the default browser.
