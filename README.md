Forecast.io in Alfred 2
===============

A Python script to display the current weather conditions from the Forecast.io API in the Alfred window. You will need Alfred 2 and a free Forecast.io API key to use this.

# Installation

To install the Forecast.io Weather workflow, double click on ```Forecast.alfredworkflow``` or drag the workflow to the workflow window in Alfred.

1. Use the [registration form](https://developer.forecast.io/register) to create a free Forecast.io developer account to get an API key.
2. [Find your latitude and longitude](http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php), but don’t use more than 4 decimal places.
3. Decide what units you would like to use for temperature. Options include Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

Next, edit the first script filter by double clicking on it. Edit the line ```print forecast(“APIKEY”, “LAT”, “LONG”, “FCK”)``` to fill in your Forecast.io API key, location, and unit preference. Be sure to keep these in quotes.

Example: ```print forcast(“APIKEY”, “52.2053”, “0.1218”, “C”)```

# How to use

Simply type ```weather``` (or whatever you configure) into Alfred. If your API access is successful, the current temperature and weather condition should appear followed by a summary of weather in the near future.

If you want more information, hit ```enter``` once the current weather has been displayed. This will open [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io) in Safari.
